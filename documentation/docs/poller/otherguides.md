# Raspberry Pi

If you'd like a simple step-by-step guide, written by a UniFi Poller user for implementation on
Docker on a Raspberry Pi then have a look at this
[nerdygeek guide](https://nerdygeek.uk/2020/06/18/unifi-poller-an-easy-step-by-step-guide/)!

Note that a Pi is not recommended for use in a long term context -
although many users have started this way, the amount and type of data collection
is better done on a more capable server.

Here's another RPi guide (in video form) from MacTelecom:
