Many thanks to [mabunixda](https://github.com/mabunixda) for helping begin our Docker support! The images are built automatically by Docker Cloud using the Dockerfile included in this repo.

The Docker Compose file and example environment variable configuration were graciously provided [@jonbloom](https://github.com/jonbloom).


### Integrations

The following fine folks are providing their services, completely free! These service integrations are used for things like storage, building, compiling, distribution and documentation support. This project succeeds because of them. Thank you!
