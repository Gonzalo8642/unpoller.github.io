If you'd like a simple step-by-step guide, written by a Unifi Poller user for implementation on Docker on a Raspberry Pi then have a look at this [link](https://nerdygeek.uk/2020/06/18/unifi-poller-an-easy-step-by-step-guide/)

Note that a Pi is not recommended for use in a long term context - although many users have started this way, the amount and type of data collection is better done on a larger machine
